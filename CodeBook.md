## Explanation of Variables

The following are the variables found in the tidy dataset (tidy_avgs.txt).

### Observation Identifiers

[1] "activity": the activity being performed; 
one of:

* WALKING
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* SITTING
* STANDING
* LAYING
    
[2] "subject": integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive) identifying which volunteer performed the activity

### Features Observed

For each activity/subject pair, we report the _average_ (over all instances of that activity/subject pair) of the mean and standard deviation of a range of variables.  
**UNITS OF ALL FEATURES are normalized, and bounded within [-1,1].**
